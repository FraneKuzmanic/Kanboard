<h2>Kanboard - project management tool</h2>

<p>
I developed Kanboard as a part of my college project. I decided to create a software that would help people collaborating on a certain project to organize their work more efficiently. 
The platform allows users to create projects, assign tasks to team members, track progress through different stages, and manage deadlines. 
Inspired by tools like <b>Trello</b> and <b>Jira</b>, Kanboard uses a visual board with columns to represent the status of tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). 
It supports features such as task prioritization, drag-and-drop task movement, and team collaboration in real time.
